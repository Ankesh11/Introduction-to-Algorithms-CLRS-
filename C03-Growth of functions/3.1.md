### Exercise 3.1-1
Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of Θ-notation, prove that max(f(n), g(n)) = Θ(f(n)+g(n)).
### `Answer`
By the definition of Θ-notation, we can write  
0 <= c1(f(n) + g(n)) <= max(f(n), g(n)) <= c2(f(n) + g(n))  
To prove this, all the inequalities need to hold true.  
As the max of two function cannot be greater than the sum of two, so c2 = 1.  
Max of two function cannot be less than average of two, so c1 = 1/2.  
And 0 <= c1(f(n) + g(n)) as the functions are nonnegative.
