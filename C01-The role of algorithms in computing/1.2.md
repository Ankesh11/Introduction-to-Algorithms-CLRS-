### Exercise 1.2-1
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms 
involved.
### `Answer`
Finger print unlocking in mobile phones by matching the stored finger print. It first stores the data and then while unlocking the device 
it matches with the stored data. The response of the algorithm should be accurate and fast.

### Exercise 1.2-2
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 
8n<sup>2</sup> steps, while merge sort runs in 64nlogn steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?
### `Answer`
For finding the value of n where merge sort beat insertion sort
8n<sup>2</sup> = 64nlogn
n = 44
so for n = 2 to 43

### Exercise 1.2-3
What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n<sup>2</sup> runs faster than an algorithm whose running 
time is 2<sup>n</sup> on the same machine?
### `Answer`
100n<sup>2</sup> < 2<sup>n</sup>  
100n<sup>2</sup> - 2<sup>n</sup> < 0  
n>=15
