### Exercise 2.3-2
Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied 
back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.
### `Answer`
```C++
void Merge(int arr[],int beg,int mid,int end){
  int temp[n];
  int i=beg, j=mid+1, k=beg;
  while(i<=mid && j<=end){
    if(arr[i]<=arr[j])
      temp[k++] = arr[i++];
    else
      temp[k++] = arr[j++];
  }
  while(i<=mid)
    temp[k++] = arr[i++];
  while(j<=end)
    temp[k++] = arr[j++];
  for(i=beg;i<=end;i++)
    arr[i] = temp[i];
}
```

### Exercise 2.3-3
Use mathematical induction to show that when n is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence  
```
T(n) = 2           if n = 2  
      2T(n/2)+n    if n = 2^k , for k>1  
```
is T(n) = nlg(n).
