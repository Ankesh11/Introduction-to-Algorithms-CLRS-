### Exercise 2.1-1
Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A = [31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58].

### Exercise 2.1-2
Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.
### `Answer`
```C++
void insertion_sort(int arr[],int n){
  for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
    int key = arr[i];
    int j = i-1;
    while(j>=0 && arr[j]<key){
      arr[j+1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }
    arr[j+1] = key;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 2.1-3
Consider the searching problem:
* **Input**: A sequence of n numbers A = [a1, a2, . . . , an] and a value v.  
* **Output**: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
### `Answer`
```
linear_search(A,v)  
  for j=1 to A.length  
    if v = A[j]  
      return j  
  return nil
```
* Initialization: We started the loop from first element of the array and check if its equal to the given value or not.
* Maintenance: Index j is always incremented by one if it doesn't find the value and indexed element is checked for the equality. The left part of the index j contains the searched value and right part contains the to be search values.
* Termination: If we find any element to be equal to the value then we return the index j and if we don't find the value, we search the whole array and loop terminates itself after j = n+1.

### Exercise 2.1-4
Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n + 1)-element array C. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.
### `Answer`
```
binary_addition(A,B)
  n = A.length
  C[n+1];
  for i=1 to n+1
    c[i] = 0
  carry = 0
  for i=n to 1
    c[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry)%2
    carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry)/2
  c[i] = carry  //i=0 here
```
